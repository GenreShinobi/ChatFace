# ChatFace

This project was started in July of 2020 as part of the [9 Projects you can do to become a Frontend Master in 2020](https://dev.to/simonholdorf/9-projects-you-can-do-to-become-a-frontend-master-in-2020-n2h). This is the 2nd project, about creating a Real-Time chat client.

- Use Vue, Vuex, Vue router, and Vue CLI to build the site
- Use Pusher API to connect the users
- Style the site using CSS

I don't believe I'll be adding any additional asks. Though, I'll think more about how to creatively push the limit of this project.
